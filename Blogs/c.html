        <h1>C Programming</h1>
        <p>Have a look for C Basic</p>
        <div class="tutorial-box">
            <div class="tutorial-content">
                C, often regarded as the lingua franca of programming languages, has a rich history dating back to its
                creation by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. Despite its age, C remains a cornerstone of
                modern computing, powering everything from operating systems to embedded systems and high-performance
                applications. Setting up a C development environment is straightforward, with compilers and toolchains
                readily available for various platforms. Mastery of C programming involves understanding low-level
                concepts such as pointers, memory management, bitwise operations, and the C preprocessor. <br>C's
                simplicity
                and efficiency make it a preferred choice for systems programming, performance-critical applications,
                and embedded systems development. The C standard library provides essential functions for input/output,
                string manipulation, and mathematical operations, while the extensive use of libraries like the Standard
                Template Library (STL) in C++ showcases the language's versatility and adaptability. The C community,
                although less centralized than some other languages, offers a wealth of resources including textbooks,
                online tutorials, and open-source projects for aspiring and experienced C programmers. <br> As C
                continues to
                be used in critical systems and emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and
                embedded systems, its relevance and importance in the field of computer science remain undiminished. C's
                influence extends beyond traditional computing domains, with its principles deeply ingrained in newer
                technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency development. Its lightweight footprint and direct
                hardware access make it ideal for resource-constrained environments, powering devices ranging from
                microcontrollers to spacecraft. The prevalence of legacy systems written in C ensures a continued demand
                for skilled C programmers, making it a valuable skill in the job market. C's role in security-critical
                applications, including cryptography and secure communications, underscores its importance in
                safeguarding sensitive information. Despite the emergence of newer languages, C's enduring popularity is
                a testament to its stability, reliability, and time-tested performance. <br><br>
                <li>Pointers: C offers direct memory access, crucial for system-level programming and efficient data
                    manipulation.</li>
                <li>Memory management: Developers manually allocate and deallocate memory, optimizing resource
                    utilization.</li>
                <li>Bitwise operations: C supports low-level bit manipulation, essential for tasks like encryption and
                    compression.</li>
                <li>C preprocessor: It handles macros and conditional compilation, enhancing code flexibility and
                    portability.</li>
                <li>Standard Template Library (STL) in C++: It provides reusable components, simplifying data structures
                    and algorithms implementation.</li>
